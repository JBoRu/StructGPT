## Usage
### 0. Requirements
You only need to install the python library and openai for querying OpenAI model API.

### 1. Prepare Dataset
We strongly suggest that download the processed datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11_2pqU_MhEtmxpp3zfK_8EJ1bbQzsnfJ?usp=sharing) and then directly use them.
Apart from downloading from their original website, we use the processed datasets from [UnifiedSKG](https://github.com/HKUNLP/UnifiedSKG).
After downloading our processed data, you can unzip them and put them in the */data* directory.

### 3. Experiment
We have organized the running and evaluation scripts for each dataset under the */script* directory.

#### Evaluation on Text-to-SQL
For **Spider** dataset, you can directly use the following command to start running and output the evaluation results:
```bash
bash ./scripts/run_spider_wo_icl_v1.sh
```

</p>

Similarly, you can run the corresponding script for **Spider-SYN** and **Spider-Realistic** to get the evaluation results.

**Spider_Realistic**

</p>

**Spider-SYN**
<p align="center">

</p>
We save all the prediction file in *outputs/* directory.

## Plan
**Note:**
Thanks for your attention. We currently update code for DB-based Text-to-SQL for interested researchers to quickly understand our StructGPT framework.
Code for TableQA will be coming tomorrow!
